Now, if we choose a small time increment represented by $\\Delta t$, we can make the assumption that the change in temperature from time t to t + $\\Delta t$, denoted as X(t+ $\\Delta t$)− X(t), follows a normal distribution. This normal distribution is characterized by a mean of 0 and a variance of $\\Delta t$.\n",

    "## Premier League Forecasting – Model Description\n",
    "Our predictive model for Premier League matches uses a simulation-based approach, underpinned by player statistics extracted using the datascraper.py script. This script gathers comprehensive data from FBref and outputs a players.json file, which serves as the foundation for determining individual player attributes and team dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Framework\n",
    "The simulation operates on a time-based system. Matches are simulated incrementally in discrete time \"ticks.\" Each tick represents a specific period within the game where players make decisions and interact with the ball. The process begins with a random home-team player (excluding the goalkeeper) taking the kick-off and passing to a teammate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### At each tick, the player in possession of the ball has the following possible outcomes (events) :\n",
    "\n",
    "Pass the Ball: The player attempts to pass the ball, influenced by their passing accuracy and team tactics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shoot: The player attempts a shot, with a scoring probability calculated based on historical data, their position, and individual scoring ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lose Possession: The player loses the ball, either due to interception, tackle, or misplay, transitioning control to the opposing team.\n",
    "\n",
    "Retain Possession: If none of the above occurs, the player holds the ball until the next tick.\n",
    "Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Meanwhile likelihood of each event is dynamically computed using these collected data:\n",
    "\n",
    "Passing Probabilities: Depend on player attributes (e.g., passing accuracy) and their role (e.g., midfielders are more likely to pass forward compared to defenders).\n",
    "\n",
    "Shooting Probabilities: Reflect player-specific data (e.g., historical goal conversion rates) and contextual factors such as distance to goal and defensive pressure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Losing Possession: Influenced by player stats (e.g., ball retention ability) and opposing team's defensive strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "For each match, we simulate thousands of iterations, each representing a potential outcome. Key outcomes (home win, away win, or draw) are determined based on goal differentials across these simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation records are given as following: Goals scored by both teams, Match outcomes (win/loss/draw), Possession statistics\n",

    "To forecast final league standings:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Match Simulation__: Each match in the season is simulated multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Aggregate Results__: The average number of wins, draws, and losses for each team is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Final Points__: Points are assigned (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss) to determine the final standings.\n",

However, we needed many past games'records with scoreline, player lineup, shooting attemps, etc. which we were not able to find or scrap. \n",

The higher a team's past rank, the larger the k is. Our scoring chance formula finally becomes $z = k (1 - x - y)$."

    "##### Conclusion on the Model's Behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "The performance of the model, as observed in the diagrams, demonstrates the following key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __General Performance__: The model generally performs well, producing simulated match scorelines that closely align with real-world outcomes. The distribution of home wins, away wins, and draws reflects realistic patterns observed in actual matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Behavior Against Different Team Strengths__: The model performs more accurately when the competing teams have players of comparable skill levels. However, in matches between a stronger and a weaker team, the model tends to exaggerate the stronger team's advantage, potentially overestimating the disparity in outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Opportunities for Improvement\n",
    "\n",
    "__Linear Regression__\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, we rely on Poisson simulation data to guide adjustments in parameter values, particularly in the logic governing shooting attempts. For example, when the simulated draw probability is significantly lower than the Poisson-predicted draw probability, we reduce the base shooting probability to increase the likelihood of draws.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the Poisson simulation data has its limitations, particularly in how team lambda is calculated. Currently, we simply sum the individual lambda values of each player in the lineup, which may not accurately reflect the true dynamics of a team’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing linear regression could significantly enhance the model’s accuracy and adaptability. \n",
    "\n",
    "By refining critical components such as shooting attempts, passing probabilities, and team lambda aggregation, linear regression can provide more precise estimates and better account for the complex interplay of factors influencing match outcomes. This integration would allow for a more nuanced and data-driven approach to optimizing parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Additionally, by introducing chi-squared test, we learned that it could be too sensitive against a very large sample size. Instead KL divergence measures how one probability distribution diverges from another. It provides a more nuanced metric for comparing the distributions than the chi-square test."
