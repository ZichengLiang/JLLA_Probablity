    "\n",
    "Consider a scenario where the temperature X(t) varies randomly over a continuous time interval t, where t is in the range from 0 to 1. We begin with the assumption that X(0) = 0, which means that the temperature at time 0 is 0. Now, if we choose a small time increment represented by ∆t, we can make the assumption that the change in temperature from time t to t + ∆t, denoted as X(t+ ∆t)− X(t), follows a normal distribution. This normal distribution is characterized by a mean of 0 and a variance of ∆t.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $P$ be the random variable denoting the proportion of time in [0, 1] such that the temperature is positive. Estimate the distribution of $P$ by Monte Carlo simulation and experimenting with various values of ∆t (e.g. ∆t = 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001, · · · .)\n",
