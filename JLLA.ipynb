We begin with the assumption that X(0) = 0, which means that the temperature at time 0 is 0. Now, if we choose a small time increment represented by ∆t, we can make the assumption that the change in temperature from time t to t + ∆t, denoted as X(t+ ∆t)− X(t), follows a normal distribution. This normal distribution is characterized by a mean of 0 and a variance of ∆t.\n",

A notable characteristic of both distributions are the heavy tails at 0 and 1. Simulating how the temperature changes over time for a few samples, we notice that some paths keep hovering over 0, shifting from positive to negative and negative and positive values. However, a good portion of paths start with a wave of positive/negative changes, and thus never go down/up to 0. These samples will have either $t_{max}=p=0$ (negative values at start) or $t_{max}=p=1.0$ (positive values at start)."
