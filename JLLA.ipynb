Now, if we choose a small time increment represented by ∆t, we can make the assumption that the change in temperature from time t to t + ∆t, denoted as X(t+ ∆t)− X(t), follows a normal distribution. This normal distribution is characterized by a mean of 0 and a variance of ∆t.\n",

Simulating how the temperature changes over time for a few samples, we notice that some paths keep hovering over 0, shifting from positive to negative and negative and positive values. However, a good portion of paths start with a wave of positive/negative changes, and thus never go down/up to 0.

    "## Premier League Forecasting – Model Description\n",
    "Our predictive model for Premier League matches uses a simulation-based approach, underpinned by player statistics extracted using the datascraper.py script. This script gathers comprehensive data from FBref and outputs a players.json file, which serves as the foundation for determining individual player attributes and team dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulation Framework\n",
    "The simulation operates on a time-based system. Matches are simulated incrementally in discrete time \"ticks.\" Each tick represents a specific period within the game where players make decisions and interact with the ball. The process begins with a random home-team player (excluding the goalkeeper) taking the kick-off and passing to a teammate.\n",
    "\n",
    "At each tick, the player in possession of the ball has the following possible outcomes (events) :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Pass the Ball__: The player attempts to pass the ball, influenced by their passing accuracy and team tactics.\n",
    "2. __Shoot__: The player attempts a shot, with a scoring probability calculated based on historical data, their position, and individual scoring ability.\n",
    "3. __Lose Possession__: The player loses the ball, either due to interception, tackle, or misplay, transitioning control to the opposing team.\n",
    "4. __Retain Possession__: If none of the above occurs, the player holds the ball until the next tick.\n",
    "Parameterization\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood of each event is dynamically computed using the collected data:\n",
    "\n",
    "- __Passing Probabilities__: Depend on player attributes (e.g., passing accuracy) and their role (e.g., midfielders are more likely to pass forward compared to defenders).\n",
    "- __Shooting Probabilities__: Reflect player-specific data (e.g., historical goal conversion rates) and contextual factors such as distance to goal and defensive pressure.\n",
    "- __Losing Possession__: Influenced by player stats (e.g., ball retention ability) and opposing team's defensive strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Monte Carlo Simulations\n",
    "For each match, we simulate thousands of iterations, each representing a potential outcome. Key outcomes (home win, away win, or draw) are determined based on goal differentials across these simulations. Each simulation records:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Goals scored by both teams\n",
    "- Match outcomes (win/loss/draw)\n",
    "- Possession statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Season Simulation\n",
    "To forecast final league standings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Match Simulation__: Each match in the season is simulated multiple times.\n",
    "2. __Aggregate Results__: The average number of wins, draws, and losses for each team is calculated.\n",
    "3. __Final Points__: Points are assigned (3 for a win, 1 for a draw, 0 for a loss) to determine the final standings.\n",
    "4. __Goal Statistics__: Average goals scored and conceded are used as secondary metrics for ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages and Limitations\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Granular player-level data ensures detailed modeling of match events.\n",
    "Monte Carlo simulations provide robust probabilistic forecasts for entire seasons.\n",
    "Flexibility to incorporate new data or refine parameters dynamically.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Computational complexity increases with the number of simulations.\n",
    "Results depend heavily on the quality and completeness of input data.\n",
    "Simplifications (e.g., ignoring injuries, weather conditions) may limit real-world accuracy.\n"

    "The simulation iterates 𝑁 = iterations times. This code is designed to use a Monte Carlo method to generate the most likely lineup to be chosen by the team for a game. We use weights based off of the players games played for the current team and their starts for the current team. We then store this in a 4 part dictionary containing the selected defenders, midfielders, forwards and goalkeeper. The size of each subsection is determined based on the teams lineups which are stored in the lineups.json file.\n",

However, we needed many past games'records with scoreline, player lineup, shooting attemps, etc. which we were not able to find or scrap. \n",

The higher a team's past rank, the larger the k is. Our scoring chance formula finally becomes $z = k (1 - x - y)$."
